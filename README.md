## Roadmap

- Wireframe
- Deployed to Fly.io
- A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- Tests for each server route
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure the app is accessible to as many different users as possible

### Stretch
